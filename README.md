# Tip Calculator

## Overview

This project is a solution to the **Tip Calculator App** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
It is a simple yet practical web application that allows users to calculate the **tip amount per person** and the **total cost per person** when splitting a bill in a group.

The project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS techniques**, and **JavaScript for dynamic interactivity**.

---

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* Enter the bill amount.
* Select a tip percentage or enter a custom percentage.
* Specify the number of people splitting the bill.
* Instantly view the **calculated tip amount per person** and the **total amount per person**.
* Reset the calculator to start a new calculation.

### Built with

* **Semantic HTML5 markup**
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox & Grid** for layout
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for functionality

---

### What I learned

This project reinforced the importance of:

* Handling **real-time input validation** and updating UI dynamically with JavaScript.
* Designing a **responsive layout** that adapts across different screen sizes.
* Implementing **reset functionality** and ensuring good user experience.
* Writing cleaner, modular JavaScript functions for calculations and DOM updates.



### Continued development

In future iterations, I would like to:

* Implement **dark mode** for better accessibility and user preference.
* Explore **localStorage** to remember user inputs for repeated use.
* Refactor the JavaScript code into more modular components for scalability.
